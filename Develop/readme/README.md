HTML CSS Git Challenge: Horiseon Code Refactor Project README.md

Project Documentation

This project was my first introduction to HTML, CSS, and Git.

The purpose: To practice real world examples of potential web development situations. There is a strong focused on semantic elements, accessibility, and a “when-then” type rubric and scenario.

The challenge: Take exsisting starter code made up of many divs. (AKA Div soup) Refactor what was given, without losing the intgrity of the site. Gain and keep a focus on attributes of assesibility.

What was gained This was a helpful project for me. I am very new to coding, and this was a week of reading, confusion, more reading, studding, office hours asking questions, and then just making so many mistakes over hours and hours until finally things clicked. They didn't come all at once. I realize the best way to learn is definitely by doing and by making a ton of mistakes. I can apply myself so much, it really comes down to doing, making a mistake, reading, another mistake, typing, google, then opps- another mistake. Lightbulb. Victory. Then do it all again.

In a real-world example this project would be so applicable for a few reasons. A friend of mine who works as a programmer told me that he sees when then type requests at his work. He isn't a web developer but i could tell he appreciated that this was something our rubric mimicked. I appreciate that this cultivates an early consideration for accessibility in web development. If it was my family member or myself wanting or needing this information, I wouldn't want to be at a disadvantage because i couldn’t have access. I have taken for granted the fact that I have never really had to think about screen readers or other forms of help that someone may need. I would also as an employee never want to cause any type of legal issue at my work for failing to do a good job.

A big take away learned: Why not just do all of this right the first time....? Here I refer to clean coding. What a pain to work through so many divs. Why not try to be more precise the first time? I will never use a div again if I can help it.
