Project Documentation

This project was my first introduction to HTML, CSS, and Git. 

The purpose was to practice real world examples of potential web development situations. This challenge focused on semantic elements, accessibility, and a “when-then” type rubric and scenario. 

I was asked to take code and refactor what was given. Look up div soup. That’s what we refactored.

This was a helpful project for me. I am new to coding, and this was a week of reading, confusion, more reading, studding, office hours asking questions, and then just making so many mistakes over hours and hours until finally things clicked. They didn't come all at once. I realize the best way to learn is definitely by doing and by making a ton of mistakes. I can apply myself so much, it really comes down to doing, making a mistake, reading, another mistake, typing, google, then opps- another mistake. Lightbulb. Victory. Then do it all again. 

In a real-world example this project would be so applicable for a few reasons. A friend of mine who works as a programmer told me that he sees when then type requests at his work. He isn't a web developer but i could tell he appreciated that this was something our rubric mimicked. I also appreciate that this cultivates an early consideration for accessibility in web development. I know If it was my family member or myself wanting or needing this information, I wouldn't want to be at a disadvantage because i couldn’t have access. Not necessarily this info but anything that i might be looking for on the web. I have taken for granted the fact that I have never really had to think about screen readers or other forms of help that someone may need. I would also as an employee never want to cause any type of legal issue at my work for failing to do a good job. 
Another big lesson learned: Why not just do all of this right the first time....? Clean coding.  What a pain. Why not try to put more correct info in? I will never use a div if I can help it.
